**Customer Churn Prediction App**

**What is this project about?** 
This project predicts if customers will stop using a service based on their information. It includes code to train a model and a simple app for making predictions.

What's Inside?
Training Code: Script to teach the computer how to predict churn.
Deployment Code: Makes the model usable in a simple app.
Model and Scaler: Ready-to-use prediction model and data transformer.
Dataset: Information used to train the model.

How to Use
Training
Run the training code (Mariam_Wahab_AIAssignment3.py) with the dataset.
It saves a trained model and a special tool for data processing.

Using the Model
Install Python and the required stuff (like numpy and pandas).
Run the deployment code (Mariam_Wahab_AIAssignment3.py).
Use the simple app to enter customer info and get churn predictions.

Tips
You need Python and some libraries.
Run scripts in a Python environment or a special program.
You can change the app to make it better or fancier.
You must have some idea and knowledge on Python and its libraries.
